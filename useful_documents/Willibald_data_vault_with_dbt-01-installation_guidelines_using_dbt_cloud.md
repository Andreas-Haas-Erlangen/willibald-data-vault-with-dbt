# Willibald data vault data warehouse with dbt installation guidelines using dbt cloud

For an overview of all the available tutorials and documents, go to [README](../README.md).

Within this document we will try to describe every step necessary to fully install the Willibald on dbt implementation in dbt cloud, trying not to assume any prior knowledge.
Our aim is, that you don't need to know anything about Snowflake, dbt cloud or data vault.

## Get Snowflake account running and connected
If you donâ€™t already have a snowflake account, now is the time to set one up (there is a 30 day free trial available).

### Sign up for a Snowflake account

Go to:
https://signup.snowflake.com/

For further information see: 
https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/admin-trial-account

The Snowflake Standard edition is enough and it doesn't matter, which cloud provider you choose and where it is located, we'd suggest to use the one nearest to you, though.

Keep the following information regarding your snowflake account, because you will need them for the configuration of dbt cloud:

    Snowflake Account:
    You will find your account in Snowflake under Admin - Accounts 
    -> click on the three dots at the end of the line with your account - Manage Urls.
    Your link will look something like https://xxxx-yy1234.snowflakecomputing.com
    only use xxxx-yy1234 as "my_account"!

    Database:
    Within Snowflake you need to create a data warehouse database.
    (Data - Databases - + Database (top right corner))
    Let's call the database DWH_WILLIBALD (in this document and its scripts it will be referenced as this).

    Warehouse:
    Under Admin - Warehouses you can create a new Warehouse or choose a standard one.
    e.g. COMPUTE_WH

    Username:
    You can also create a specific user for accessing snowflake from dbt.

    Password:


## Connect to the source data

Our initial setup contained an AWS S3 datalake with external tables in snowflake referencing them. 
To simplify the process we now offer the data as a snowflake private share named DWA_COMPARE (mimicking the external tables). 
If you want to access it, just contact us, we are happy to add you.

See [Willibald data vault with dbt - 00 - introduction](Willibald_data_vault_with_dbt-00-introduction.md) for contact data.

All we need from you is your Snowflake account name.
Within Snowflake/Admin/Accounts click on your account and copy the link, it will look like:
https://xxxx-yy1234.snowflakecomputing.com

As soon as we added you to the private share, the database dwa_compare will show up under Snowflake/Data Products/Private Sharing.
You will need to click on GET to activate this private share for you.

## Fork repository in GitHub

Log into your github account (or create one).
Search for our repository: willibald-data-vault-with-dbt
Fork the repository.

## Set up a dbt cloud account
If you haven't already, set up a dbt cloud account:https://www.getdbt.com/signup

When asked, answer that you have a data warehouse.

Choose Snowflake as database
(there is an extensive documentation available in dbt, if there are any further questions).

On the following configuration page you will need all the information you gathered during the setup of your snowflake account:

Account
Database
Warehouse

User
Password

Schema 
    You can keep the default

Target name keep default

Threads keep default

--> Test connection
Let's hope you see this, otherwise check the troubleshooting pages from dbt

Choose GitHub

LogIn and authorize dbt 
 you only need to authorize the forked repository.

Click: Start developing in the IDE

### Define Environment Variables

Click: Deploy - Environments
choose Environment variables and add the following two Variables:
  
|            |                     |          |
| ---------- | ------------------- | -------- |
| **Environment Variable**   | **Name**        | **comment** |
| DBT_SOURCE_DATABASE      | DWA_COMPARE            | the databaseshare we offer as a private    |
| DBT_DATABASE        | DWH_WILLIBALD               | or any other DB name you chose for your DWH   |

Back to Develop - Cloud IDE 



change branch and checkout dbt-cloud
In case there is a lock file under version control, delete this (revert) - then you can change the branch.



## Run the full solution

Now you can run the following command within your dbt cloud environment to generate the complete solution.

(bottom left)

```
dbt build
```

If you did everything right and we documented everything properly, you now should have the complete solution up and running. You are now all set to discover the solution, see the other tutorials regarding this [README](../README.md).

If you encountered any problems, found topics we should add to this description to make it easier for others to set it up, please contact us:  
See [Willibald data vault with dbt - 00 - introduction](Willibald_data_vault_with_dbt-00-introduction.md) for contact data.
